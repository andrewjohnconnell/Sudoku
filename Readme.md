#Sudoku Sans Frontieres
A little Sudoku game implemented in Java, because I was fed up being hounded by family to produce one.

## How to play
Just clicky the buttons and put the right numbers in the right place.
If you get really stuck, I put a Tile Confirmation tool in the menu bar - just turn it on and it will lock correct values when you enter them.

## Credits
To be fair to them, the Yering Estate probably did me more good writing this one up than the coffee producers did.  Sudoku's really good fun when you've had a glass or two of red...
